## Abstract
In the current era, aquaculture plays a pivotal role in our nation's economy. However, the presence of fish diseases poses a significant challenge, leading to substantial productivity and economic losses across aquaculture farms of all scales. Detecting unhealthy fish manually is labor-intensive and time-consuming, necessitating the implementation of intelligent systems for efficient disease prevention and fish welfare. The initial step in fish health monitoring is automated and precise fish detection from underwater images/videos, which is highly challenging due to complex underwater conditions, such as variable lighting, water turbulence, and object occlusion. To address this, a study introduced the CLAHE-YOLOv8s fish detection algorithm, utilizing Contrast Light Adaptive Histogram Equalization to enhance underwater images and achieve more accurate fish detection. Training with a pond fish dataset of 5,950 images, the CLAHE-YOLOv8s model demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy and processing time compared to MSR-YOLOv8s (Multi Scale Retinex Enhancement). Future improvements could involve training the models with pre-trained weights from other public fish detection datasets to enhance accuracy.
